    <!-- There are several submission photos, bulletin-submission, family-submission, camping-submission...., that are quite large.
    They can be moved to S3 and referenced in the project so the project loads faster. -->
    <!-- The favicon is also quite large. that  file can probably just be smaller. -->

    <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
